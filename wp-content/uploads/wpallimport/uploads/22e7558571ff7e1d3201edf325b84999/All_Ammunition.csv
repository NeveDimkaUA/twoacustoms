52125,Hornady,8052,10,270 Win 130gr GMX SPF /20,270 Winchester,SUPERFORMANCE ammunition is loaded with proprietary propellants that increase the velocity ratings up to 200 feet per second compared to other popular brands. Because there is no increase in pressure regardless of the caliber there is no increase in felt recoil but there IS an increase in efficiency and high speed performance. From sub-zero arctic temperatures to almost unbearable desert heat SUPERFORMANCE ammunition can withstand any hunting habitat. <br><br>Hard-hitting and deep-penetrating the GMX bullet combines monolithic construction with pioneering ballistic design to meet the need for a premium non-traditional bullet. The mono-metal design of the GMX bullet is crafted from a copper alloy. Harder than solid copper the copper/zinc alloy has been proven to shoot cleaner foul less and deliver consistent even pressure curves. The tough alloy material routinely retains 95% or more of its original weight and expands up to 1.5 times its original diameter. Featuring a long sleek profile with cannelures the design reduces the bullet's overall bearing surface and drag while achieving some of the highest ballistic coefficients from monolithic non-traditional bullets. Initiating expansion upon impact the hard polymer tip drives into the hollow cavity at the front of the bullet creating a mushroom-style projectile as it travels through the animal. Fully California compatible and appropriate for use in other areas requiring the use of non-traditional bullets GMX is ideal for any sized game from antelope to moose.

73700,Federal Cartridge,XM856,0,5.56x45mm 64gr FMJ Tracer /20,5.56x45mm NATO,This Federal American Eagle Ammunition is genuine Lake City Ammunition Plant overrun ammunition. This tracer ammunition is loaded to military specification and is perfect for providing the shooter with immediate feedback through trajectory visualization by allowing the bullet path to be seen. Tracer ammunition is a great choice for banging away at steel targets casual plinking and high-volume blasting sessions. The military uses tracer ammunition as an efficient tool for signaling.  They are effective for use as pre-arranged signals between units and individuals; they also can be used to designate targets. As tracers burn very bright and very hot they may catch surrounding vegetation on fire so they should only be used where there is a limited chance of the shooter starting a fire. This ammunition is loaded with a delayed ignition tracer meaning it will not ignite for 50-100 yards. This means the tracer is not burning up barrels prematurely causing damage to expensive firearms. This ammunition is new production non-corrosive in boxer-primed reloadable Lake City brass cases. <br><br>Specifications:<br><br>- Caliber: 5.56x45mm NATO<br>- Bullet Weight: 64 Grains<br>- Bullet Style: Orange Tipped XM856 FMJ Tracer<br>- Case Type: Brass<br>- Quantity: Per 20<br><br>Ballistics Information:<br><br>- Muzzle Velocity: 3020 fps<br>- Muzzle Energy: 1255 ft lbs,fedepicxm856.jpg,11.28,0,16.95,0,0.6,4.125,2.4375,0.9375,Ammunition,Centerfire Rifle Ammunition,AM,FEDE,www.federalpremium.com,YPO,American Eagle Tactical Tracer 64 Grains Full Metal Jacket Per 20,C,029465099800,86858,<a target="_blank" href="http://68.168.105.47/prodpics/restrictions.pdf" >Restricted Areas Document -- Please Read</a>,,th_fedepicxm856.gif,,,,,,,,,,0,,25,20,11,https://images.dealerease.net/prodpics/fedepicxm856.jpg,1,1,

Suitable rifles include T/C Encore "modified" Marlin 1894 (see next paragraph) Winchester 1894 any rifle with a falling block action and the Handi Rifle<br><br>What does Buffalo Bore mean above by "modified" Marlin Marlin (for an unknown not well thought out reason) is using a very slow rate of twist (1/38 inches) on their 1894 chambered in 44 mag. Because of this slow rate of twist the heaviest bullet that the factory Marlin will stabilize is about 270grs. Other firearm makers that chamber for the 44 mag all use a much faster rate of twist so that their guns will stabilize and therefore accurately shoot bullets over 300grs. Many folks today want their 44 magnums to be able to utilize the heavy 300gr. and heavier bullets - Marlin has not figured this out. If you want decent accuracy out of the +p+ load in a Marlin it will need to be re-barreled with a twist rate of roughly 1/20 inch.,buffpic4d20.jpg,29.83,0,41.77,0,1.45,4.25,4,2.625,Ammunition,Centerfire Handgun Ammunition,AM,BUFF,www.buffalobore.com,,,C,651815004242,89534,<a target="_blank" href="http://68.168.105.47/prodpics/restrictions.pdf" >Restricted Areas Document -- Please Read</a>,,th_buffpic4d20.gif,,,,,,,,,,0,,12,20,13,https://images.dealerease.net/prodpics/buffpic4d20.jpg,2,2,

113429,Federal Cartridge,AE22SUP1,0,22LR 42gr CopperPlate Subsonic /50,22 Long Rifle,Federal American Eagle Suppressor Ammunition was designed from the ground up to provide the ultimate in reliability and cleanliness in suppressed firearms. The ballisticians at Federal Premium tailored each load for suppressor usage; each load has the cleanest fastest burning powder for that caliber to help keep suppressed firearms as clean as possible while maintaining subsonic velocities. The bullet weights and profiles selected for each round were chosen to give each load the most consistent accurate performance of any suppressor specific ammunition on the market. Subsonic loads are ideal for shooting through suppressors because they help reduce the sound signature even more. Subsonic rounds do not exhibit a supersonic crack making them quieter when shot through your favorite can. This ammunition does not have to be fired through a suppressed firearm and will function in non-suppressed firearms. This ammunition is new production and non-corrosive. <br><br>Specifications:<br><br>- Caliber: 22 Long Rifle<br>- Bullet Weight: 42 Grains<br>- Bullet Style: Copper Plated Solid<br>- Case Type: Brass<br>- Quantity: Per 50<br><br>Ballistics Information<br><br>- Muzzle Velocity: 970 fps<br>- Velocity Rating: Subsonic<br>- Muzzle Energy: 94 ft lbs,fedepicae22sup1.jpg,2.73,0,4.95,0,0.4,2.875,1.5,1,Ammunition,Rimfire Ammunition,AM,FEDE,www.federalpremium.com,HME,American Eagle Suppressor 45 Grains Copper Plated Lead Round Nose Per 50,C,029465058265,106733,<a target="_blank" href="http://68.168.105.47/prodpics/restrictions.pdf" >Restricted Areas Document -- Please Read</a>,,th_fedepicae22sup1.gif,,,,,,,,,,0,,100,50,14,https://images.dealerease.net/prodpics/fedepicae22sup1.jpg,1,1,

The engineers have welded together the lead and jacket to obtain controlled expansion and a higher weight retention. The bonding can also take on the toughest barriers at varied ranges and velocities to simulate real world threat. <br><br>Upon impact the jacketed hollow point initiates expansion up to 1-1/2 times the size of the original bullet diameter. The unique notching in the bullet creates six equal segments creating maximum expansion on impact.

113426,Federal Cartridge,AE300BLKSUP2,0,300BO Subsonic 220gr /20,300 AAC Blackout,Federal American Eagle Suppressor Ammunition was designed from the ground up to provide the ultimate in reliability and cleanliness in suppressed firearms. The ballisticians at Federal Premium tailored each load for suppressor usage; each load has the cleanest fastest burning powder for that caliber to help keep suppressed firearms as clean as possible while maintaining subsonic velocities. The bullet weights and profiles selected for each round were chosen to give each load the most consistent accurate performance of any suppressor specific ammunition on the market. Subsonic loads are ideal for shooting through suppressors because they help reduce the sound signature even more. Subsonic rounds do not exhibit a supersonic crack making them quieter when shot through your favorite can. This ammunition does not have to be fired through a suppressed firearm and will function in non-suppressed firearms. This ammunition is new production non-corrosive in boxer primed reloadable brass cases. <br><br>Specifications:<br><br>- Caliber: 300 AAC Blackout<br>- Bullet Weight: 220 Grains<br>- Bullet Style: Open Tip Match<br>- Case Type: Brass<br>- Quantity: Per 20<br><br>Ballistics Information:<br><br>- Muzzle Velocity: 1000 fps<br>- Muzzle Energy: 488 ft lbs,fedepicae300blksup2.jpg,19.62,0,28.95,0,0.95,3.875,2.5,1,Ammunition,Centerfire Rifle Ammunition,AM,FEDE,www.federalpremium.com,10H,American Eagle Suppressor 220 Grains Open Tip Match Subsonic  Per 20,C,029465064617,107699,<a target="_blank" href="http://68.168.105.47/prodpics/restrictions.pdf" >Restricted Areas Document -- Please Read</a>,,th_fedepicae300blksup2.gif,,,,,,,,,,0,,25,20,11,https://images.dealerease.net/prodpics/fedepicae300blksup2.jpg,2,2,

Even the heaviest clothing barriers have no effect on the terminal performance of the ARX bullet. The ARX penetrates straight until it encounters soft tissue. Upon entering soft tissue the specially designed grooves in the nose harness the rotational energy of the bullet during the initial 6" of penetration.<br><br>The features in the nose of the ARX bullet also create hydrodynamic ram which compresses the fluid-filled tissue ahead of the bullet and creates an envelope around the bullet.<br><br>At this point the bullet tumbles on a helical path and continues to create a large temporary cavity. As the bullet penetrates it tumbles in a controlled predictable fashion that delivers very consistent terminal performance that equals or exceeds conventional hollow point designs. In soft tissue the ARX is designed to penetrate 12" to 14" every time.<br><br>Specifications:<br><br>- Caliber: .380 Auto<br>- Bullet Weight: 65 Grains<br>- Velocity: 1150 FPS<br>- Quantity: 25 Rounds,polypic380arxbr-25.jpg,15.1,24.99,29.99,0,0.45,2.5,2.25,1.25,Ammunition,Centerfire Handgun Ammunition,AM,POLY,www.polycaseammo.com,XIB,56 Grains ARX Self Defense Brass Case Per 25,C,856035004403,118662,<a target="_blank" href="http://68.168.105.47/prodpics/restrictions.pdf" >Restricted Areas Document -- Please Read</a>,,th_polypic380arxbr-25.gif,,,,,,,,,,0,,10,25,13,https://images.dealerease.net/prodpics/polypic380arxbr-25.jpg,1,1,

This performance is achieved by revolutionary new extremely efficient powders optimized for each load.<br><br>Superformance ammunition is safely within SAAMI pressure guidelines. Gas operated firearms are perfectly safe to use with Superformance ammunition. However we have conducted tests and conclude that some systems work far better than others.<br><br>Features:<br><br>- Fast: Superformance ammunition is 100 to 200 fps FASTER than any conventional ammunition on the market today and achieves this performance in EVERY gun WITHOUT increases in felt recoil muzzle blast temperature sensitivity fouling or loss of accuracy.<br>- Innovative: Superformance is a cutting edge technological advancement in ammunition design that transcends convention and achieves the highest performance of any ammunition on the market today.<br>- Specialized: Superformance uses ultra progressive propellants that take your favorite SST or GMX bullets to levels of performance that are simply unattainable with conventional propellants. In order to get more velocity in the past  shooters have used a brute force approach  large charge weights of a slow burning powder in a larger cartridge case. Ultimately this leads to more recoil and muzzle blast. The Superformance solution is an elegant approach that utilizes specialized powdersat NORMAL charge weights that impart ALL useable energy to the bullet reducing the ROCKET NOZZLE EFFECT at the muzzle while still increasing velocity!<br>- Versatile: Superformance provides increased performance and is safe to use in ALL firearms including semi-autos lever gun and pump actions.<br>- Increases in rifle performance no increases in barrel wear and felt recoil along with superior temperature stability are all realized with Superformance ammunition.<br><br>Specifications:<br><br>- Ballistic Coefficient (G1): .485<br>- Sectional Density: .271<br>- Test Barrel Length (inches): 24<br>- Quantity: 20/Box,hornpic82196.jpg,31.05,0,60.9,0,1.6,6.5,4,1.25,Ammunition,Centerfire Rifle Ammunition,AM,HORN,www.hornady.com,HJT,Superformance 180gr GMX Per 20,C,090255821963,130197,,,th_hornpic82196.gif,,,,,,,,,,0,,10,1,11,https://images.dealerease.net/prodpics/hornpic82196.jpg,2,2,
296493,Polycase Ammunition,0357MAIARX086-001B00020P,0,357Mag 86gr ARX/20,357 Magnum 86 Grains ARX Per 50,From the way it is manufactured to its shape to the way it transfers energy to the target. To understand the ARX one needs to forget nearly everything theyve been told about bullets. The non-expanding ARX is injection molded from a specially blended metal/polymer matrix that is designed to be tough enough to penetrate soft targets and tissue but when it encounters tougher barriers it is designed to break apart to reduce the risk of collateral damage due to over penetration.<br><br>Even the heaviest clothing barriers have little to no effect on the terminal performance of the ARX bullet. The ARX penetrates straight until it encounters soft tissue. Upon entering soft tissue the specially designed grooves in the nose harness the soft tissue and constrict pressurize and eject it at 1.5 to 2 times the directional speed of the bullet.  This is the well-known Venturi Effect.  As the bullet penetrates it tumbles in a controlled predictable fashion that delivers consistent terminal performance that rivals conventional hollow point designs.<br><br>Features:<br><br>- Revolutionary Defense Technology: From the research and development laboratory of PolyCase Ammunition the Inceptor ARX is the next-generation of defense ammunition. Through advanced design and materials science the ARX uses fluid dynamics and non-expanding surface area instead of expansion to achieve terminal performance.<br>- Engineered Fluid Dynamics: By design the enhanced surface area and design of the ARX exploit the bullets forward energy and redirect that energy in the form of hydraulic displacement (hydrostatic shock). This hydraulic displacement creates a wound cavity that rivals that created by expanding bullets.<br>- Lateral Force: The ARX bullets hydraulic displacement effect is achieved by the ARX technology. The ARX flutes  grooves on the nose of the bullet  have wide mouths and narrow exit points. When combined with the bullets forward velocity into soft tissue the design of the ARX flutes causes an increase in pressure of the fluid.  As a result the fluid is laterally ejected from the flutes at a higher velocity than the actual speed of the bullet itself creating the massive cavitation and wound channels seen in the ARX gelatin tests.<br>- Specially Engineered Profile: Because it has no hollow-point or sharp edges on the nose of the bullet the ARX feeds like a round nose yet retains stopping power and terminal performance that exceeds many expanding handgun bullets.<br>- Precise: Injection molded ARX projectiles deliver exceptional accuracy<br>- High Velocity: Achieves higher velocity and higher energy than many other defense cartridges yet imparts less recoil for quicker follow up shots.<br>- Advanced Materials: Performs in a wide range of conditions and weapons systems including suppressed.<br>       <br>Specifications:<br> <br>- Caliber: 357 Magnum<br>- Quantity: 20 Cartridges<br>- Grains: 86 gr ARX<br>- 1650 fps / 520 ft. lbs.,polypic0357maiarx086-001b00020p.jpg,15.76,0,24.99,0,0.55,2.75,2.25,1.75,Ammunition,Centerfire Handgun Ammunition,AM,POLY,www.polycaseammo.com,,,C,813412020715,138009,,,th_polypic0357maiarx086-001b00020p.gif,,,,,,,,,,0,,10,1,13,https://images.dealerease.net/prodpics/polypic0357maiarx086-001b00020p.jpg,1,1,

113427,Federal Cartridge,AE9SUP1,0,9mm 124gr FMJ SubSonic /50,9mm Luger,Federal American Eagle Suppressor Ammunition was designed from the ground up to provide the ultimate in reliability and cleanliness in suppressed firearms. The ballisticians at Federal Premium tailored each load for suppressor usage; each load has the cleanest fastest burning powder for that caliber to help keep suppressed firearms as clean as possible while maintaining subsonic velocities. The bullet weights and profiles selected for each round were chosen to give each load the most consistent accurate performance of any suppressor specific ammunition on the market. Subsonic loads are ideal for shooting through suppressors because they help reduce the sound signature even more. Subsonic rounds do not exhibit a supersonic crack making them quieter when shot through your favorite can. This ammunition does not have to be fired through a suppressed firearm and will function in non-suppressed firearms. This ammunition is new production non-corrosive in boxer primed reloadable brass cases. <br><br>Specifications:<br><br>- Caliber: 9mm Luger<br>- Bullet Weight: 124 Grains<br>- Bullet Style: Full Metal Jacket<br>- Case Type: Brass<br>- Quantity: Per 50<br><br>Ballistics Information:<br><br>- Muzzle Velocity: 1030 fps<br>- Muzzle Energy: 292 ft lbs,fedepicae9sup1.jpg,13.69,0,20.95,0,1.45,5.062,2.75,1.375,Ammunition,Centerfire Handgun Ammunition,AM,FEDE,www.federalpremium.com,HNU,American Eagle Suppressor 124 Grains Full Metal Jacket Subsonic Per 50,C,029465064037,107698,<a target="_blank" href="http://68.168.105.47/prodpics/restrictions.pdf" >Restricted Areas Document -- Please Read</a>,,th_fedepicae9sup1.gif,,,,,,,,,,0,,10,50,13,https://images.dealerease.net/prodpics/fedepicae9sup1.jpg,2,2,

296491,Polycase Ammunition,0458SOIARX200-001B00020P,7,.458 SOCOM 200gr ARX/20,458 SOCOM,At PolyCase's mission is simple: leverage the latest technologies to create the next generation of defense training and hunting ammunition with tried and true performance. Polycase accomplished this mission with the introduction of the Inceptor Preferred Hunting line featuring the patent-pending PolyCase ARX projectile. This non-expanding projectile is light fast and has low recoil while retaining a flat trajectory. Its fluted design ensures exceptional reliability and terminal performance while diminishing the possibility of over-penetration. <br><br>ARX bullets are engineered for hydraulic displacement and terminal energy transfer to targets.. <br><br>ARX design pressurizes and ejects fluid target matter. A bullet traveling at 1400 FPS upon terminal impact will cause fluid matter to eject laterally at 1.5 to 2 times the normal speed of the bullet (21002800 FPS). This is the result of the well-known Venturi Effect.<br><br>Features:<br><br>- Revolutionary Hunting Technology: From the research and development laboratory of PolyCase Ammunition the Inceptor ARX is the next-generation of hunting ammunition. Through advanced design and materials science the ARX uses fluid dynamics and non-expanding surface area instead of expansion to achieve terminal performance.<br>- Engineered Fluid Dynamics: By design the enhanced surface area and design of the ARX exploit the bullets forward energy and redirect that energy in the form of hydraulic displacement (hydrostatic shock). This hydraulic displacement creates a wound cavity that rivals that created by expanding bullets.<br>- Lateral Force: The ARX bullets hydraulic displacement effect is achieved by the ARX technology. The ARX flutes  grooves on the nose of the bullet  have wide mouths and narrow exit points. When combined with the bullets forward velocity into soft tissue the design of the ARX flutes causes an increase in pressure of the fluid.  As a result the fluid is laterally ejected from the flutes at a higher velocity than the actual speed of the bullet itself creating the massive cavitation and wound channels seen in the ARX gelatin tests.<br>- Specially Engineered Profile: Because it has no hollow-point or sharp edges on the nose of the bullet the ARX feeds like a round nose yet retains stopping power and terminal performance that rivals expanding bullets.<br>- Precise: Injection molded ARX projectiles deliver exceptional accuracy.<br>- High Velocity: Achieves higher velocity and higher energy than many other hunting cartridges yet imparts less recoil for quicker follow up shots.<br>- Advanced Materials: Performs in a wide range of conditions and weapons systems<br><br>Specifications:<br> <br>- Caliber: .458 SOCOM ARX<br>- Muzzle Velocity: 2250 fps<br>- Bullet Weight: 200 Grains<br>- Muzzle Energy: 2249 ft. lbs.<br>- Quantity: 20,polypic0458solarx200-001b00020p.jpg,45.6,0,69.99,0,1.3,3.25,2.5,2.25,Ammunition,Centerfire Rifle Ammunition,AM,POLY,www.polycaseammo.com,71B,200 Grains ARX Per 20,C,813412020654,138958,,,th_polypic0458solarx200-001b00020p.gif,,,,,,,,,,0,,10,1,11,https://images.dealerease.net/prodpics/polypic0458solarx200-001b00020p.jpg,2,2,

To understand the ARX one needs to forget nearly everything theyve been told about bullets. The non-expanding ARX is injection molded from a specially blended metal/polymer matrix that is designed to be tough enough to penetrate soft targets and tissue but when it encounters tougher barriers it is designed to break apart to reduce the risk of collateral damage due to over penetration.<br><br>Even the heaviest clothing barriers have little to no effect on the terminal performance of the ARX bullet. The ARX penetrates straight until it encounters soft tissue. Upon entering soft tissue the specially designed grooves in the nose harness the soft tissue and constrict pressurize and eject it at 1.5 to 2 times the directional speed of the bullet.  This is the well-known Venturi Effect.  As the bullet penetrates it tumbles in a controlled predictable fashion that delivers consistent terminal performance that rivals conventional hollow point designs.<br><br>Features:<br><br>- Revolutionary Defense Technology: From the research and development laboratory of PolyCase Ammunition the Inceptor ARX is the next-generation of defense ammunition.

However those of you who choose to carry a 10MM pistol for social purposes would be best advised to carry these Tactical loads which are more than powerful enough to quell any human threat but will offer you more control and faster more accurate follow-up shots. Buffalo Bore Tactical loads utilize low-flash powders. This is an advantage should you be required to drop the hammer in low light which is when most human predators are out and about.<br><br>Specifications:<br><br>- Caliber: 10mm Auto<br>- Quantity: 20 Round<br>- Grain Weight: 180 Grains<br>- Muzzle Velocity: 1200 Feet Per Second<br>- Muzzle Energy: 575 Foot Pounds<br>- Bullet Style: Full Metal Jacket<br>- Lead Free: No<br>- Case Type: Brass<br>- Primer: Boxer<br>- Corrosive: No<br>- Reloadable: Yes,buffpic21g20.jpg,22.53,0,31.54,0,0.85,4.25,4,2.5,Ammunition,Centerfire Handgun Ammunition,AM,BUFF,www.buffalobore.com,57G,180 Grains Full Metal Jacket-FN.

The ballisticians at Federal Premium tailored each load for suppressor usage; each load has the cleanest fastest burning powder for that caliber to help keep suppressed firearms as clean as possible while maintaining subsonic velocities. The bullet weights and profiles selected for each round were chosen to give each load the most consistent accurate performance of any suppressor specific ammunition on the market. Subsonic loads are ideal for shooting through suppressors because they help reduce the sound signature even more. Subsonic rounds do not exhibit a supersonic crack making them quieter when shot through your favorite can. This ammunition does not have to be fired through a suppressed firearm and will function in non-suppressed firearms.

267618,Polycase Ammunition,0040SWRARX097-001B00020P,8,Ruger 40S&W 107gr ARX /20,40 Smith & Wesson,To understand the ARX one needs to forget nearly everything they've been told about bullets. The non-expanding ARX is injection molded from a specially blended copper/polymer matrix that is designed to be tough enough to penetrate soft targets and tissue but when it encounters tougher barriers it is designed to break apart to reduce the risk for collateral damage due to over penetration.  Even the heaviest clothing barriers have no effect on the terminal performance of the ARX bullet. The ARX penetrates straight until it encounters soft tissue. Upon entering soft tissue the specially designed grooves in the nose harness the rotational energy of the bullet during the initial 6 inches of penetration. As the bullet penetrates it tumbles in a controlled predictable fashion that delivers very consistent terminal performance that equals or exceeds conventional hollow point designs.  The flutes in the nose of the ARX bullet harness the gain in kinetic energy accrued due to the increased velocity of fluid through the constriction designed into those flutes.  Fluid passing through the ARX flutes travels between one-and-a-half to two-times the velocity of the bullet.<br><br>Features:<br><br>- REVOLUTIONARY SELF-DEFENSE TECHNOLOGY: From the research and development laboratory of PolyCase Ammunition the Inceptor ARX is the next-generation of self-defense ammunition. Through advanced design and materials science the ARX uses fluid dynamics instead of expansion to achieve superior terminal performance.<br>- ENGINEERED FLUID DYNAMICS: By design the enhanced surface area and design of the ARX exploit the bullet's forward energy and redirect that energy in the form of hydraulic displacement (hydrostatic shock). This hydraulic displacement creates a wound cavity that matches or exceeds that created by expanding bullets.<br>- LATERAL FORCE: The ARX bullet's hydraulic displacement effect is achieved by the ARX technology. The ARX flutes  grooves on the nose of the bullet  have wide mouths and narrow exit points. When combined with the bullet's forward velocity into soft tissue the design of the ARX flutes causes an increase in pressure of the fluid.  As a result the fluid is laterally ejected from the flutes at a higher velocity than the actual speed of the bullet itself creating the massive cavitation and wound channels seen in the ARX gelatin tests.<br>- SPECIALLY ENGINEERED PROFILE: Because it has no hollow-point or sharp edges on the nose of the bullet the ARX feeds like a round nose yet retains stopping power and terminal performance that exceeds most expanding handgun bullets.<br>- PRECISE: Injection molded ARX projectiles deliver exceptional accuracy.<br>- HIGH VELOCITY: Achieves higher velocity and higher energy than other self-defense rounds yet develops less recoil for quicker follow up shots.<br>- ADVANCED MATERIALS: Performs in a wide range of conditions and weapons systems including suppressed.,polypic40arxrug-20.jpg,15.13,20.99,29.99,0,0.5,3,2.25,1.25,Ammunition,Centerfire Handgun Ammunition,AM,POLY,www.polycaseammo.com,XIA,107 Grains ARX Per 20,C,813412020333,131226,,,th_polypic40arxrug-20.gif,,,,,,,,,,0,,10,1,13,https://images.dealerease.net/prodpics/polypic40arxrug-20.jpg,1,1,

296480,Polycase Ammunition,0045AUICOM999-001S00120P,12,45ACP 130gr RNP SportUte 118gr ARX 1440rd,45 Auto,Polucase .45 Auto Combo Pack<br><br>From the way it is manufactured to its shape to the way it transfers energy to the target. To understand the ARX one needs to forget nearly everything theyve been told about bullets. The non-expanding ARX is injection molded from a specially blended metal/polymer matrix that is designed to be tough enough to penetrate soft targets and tissue but when it encounters tougher barriers it is designed to break apart to reduce the risk of collateral damage due to over penetration.<br><br>Even the heaviest clothing barriers have little to no effect on the terminal performance of the ARX bullet. The ARX penetrates straight until it encounters soft tissue. Upon entering soft tissue the specially designed grooves in the nose harness the soft tissue and constrict pressurize and eject it at 1.5 to 2 times the directional speed of the bullet. This is the well-known Venturi Effect. As the bullet penetrates it tumbles in a controlled predictable fashion that delivers consistent terminal performance that rivals conventional hollow point designs.<br><br>Features:<br><br>- Revolutionary Defense Technology: From the research and development laboratory of PolyCase Ammunition the Inceptor ARX is the next-generation of defense ammunition. Through advanced design and materials science the ARX uses fluid dynamics and non-expanding surface area instead of expansion to achieve terminal performance.<br>- Engineered Fluid Dynamics: By design the enhanced surface area and design of the ARX exploit the bullets forward energy and redirect that energy in the form of hydraulic displacement (hydrostatic shock). This hydraulic displacement creates a wound cavity that rivals that created by expanding bullets.<br>- Lateral Force: The ARX bullets hydraulic displacement effect is achieved by the ARX technology. The ARX flutes  grooves on the nose of the bullet  have wide mouths and narrow exit points. When combined with the bullets forward velocity into soft tissue the design of the ARX flutes causes an increase in pressure of the fluid. As a result the fluid is laterally ejected from the flutes at a higher velocity than the actual speed of the bullet itself creating the massive cavitation and wound channels seen in the ARX gelatin tests.<br>- Specially Engineered Profile: Because it has no hollow-point or sharp edges on the nose of the bullet the ARX feeds like a round nose yet retains stopping power and terminal performance that exceeds many expanding handgun bullets.<br>- Precise: Injection molded ARX projectiles deliver exceptional accuracy<br>- High Velocity: Achieves higher velocity and higher energy than many other defense cartridges yet imparts less recoil for quicker follow up shots.<br>- Advanced Materials: Performs in a wide range of conditions and weapons systems including suppressed.<br><br>Specifications:<br><br>- Caliber: 45 Auto<br>- Quantity: 20 Cartridges<br>- Grains: 118 gr ARX<br>- 1307 fps / 448 ft. lbs. <br><br>PolyCase Ammunition re-introduces its Inceptor Sport Utility line of ammunition featuring injection-molded copper-polymer bullets loaded to tight specifications in high-quality brass cases.

Please note that this ammunition is not intended for older guns. It is made for modern firearms only as some of the ammunition could damage older and weaker firearms. This ammunition is new production non-corrosive in boxer primed reloadable brass cases.<br><br>Buffalo Bore full power loads were originally designed for outdoor uses such as hunting deer or stopping aggressive bears and these full power loads are wonderful for these types of applications. However for general self defense the excessive recoil and muzzle blast of turbo charged 10MM ammo becomes a disadvantage for fast follow-up shots needed for multiple assailants or armed human targets in general. Too much power/over-kill is not a bad thing until you have to deal with the unnecessary recoil and muzzle blast/flash which can put you at a tactical disadvantage. Buffalo Bore designed these new Tactical 10MM loads specifically to give every advantage to the user in the event that your 10MM pistol is needed in protecting you or loved ones against human threat. If your main purpose for carrying a 10MM pistol is outdoor usage we suggest you stick with the full power 10MM (items 21A 21B and 21C) loads.

One key to superior performance is the stringent manufacturing process whish Speer has developed. It all starts with an alloyed lead cor being formed to a basic shape. From there the core goes through a unique electrochemical process which bonds jacket to core one molecule at a time. Speer's Uni-Cor process provides for uniform jacket wall thickness and virtually eliminates jacket slippage or separation.<br><br>Next the bullet moves to a patented multiple "star stab" swaging operation which not only creates the unique Gold Dot hollow point cavitiy but at the same time forms an extremely uniform heel radius. The uniform heel radius ensures accuracy throughout bullet flight from start to finish.

296490,Polycase Ammunition,0009LUIARX065-001B00025P,6,9mm 65gr ARX/25,9mm Luger,From the way it is manufactured to its shape to the way it transfers energy to the target. To understand the ARX one needs to forget nearly everything theyve been told about bullets. The non-expanding ARX is injection molded from a specially blended metal/polymer matrix that is designed to be tough enough to penetrate soft targets and tissue but when it encounters tougher barriers it is designed to break apart to reduce the risk of collateral damage due to over penetration.<br><br>Even the heaviest clothing barriers have little to no effect on the terminal performance of the ARX bullet. The ARX penetrates straight until it encounters soft tissue. Upon entering soft tissue the specially designed grooves in the nose harness the soft tissue and constrict pressurize and eject it at 1.5 to 2 times the directional speed of the bullet.  This is the well-known Venturi Effect.  As the bullet penetrates it tumbles in a controlled predictable fashion that delivers consistent terminal performance that rivals conventional hollow point designs.<br><br>Features:<br><br>- Revolutionary Defense Technology: From the research and development laboratory of PolyCase Ammunition the Inceptor ARX is the next-generation of defense ammunition. Through advanced design and materials science the ARX uses fluid dynamics and non-expanding surface area instead of expansion to achieve terminal performance.<br>- Engineered Fluid Dynamics: By design the enhanced surface area and design of the ARX exploit the bullets forward energy and redirect that energy in the form of hydraulic displacement (hydrostatic shock). This hydraulic displacement creates a wound cavity that rivals that created by expanding bullets.<br>- Lateral Force: The ARX bullets hydraulic displacement effect is achieved by the ARX technology. The ARX flutes  grooves on the nose of the bullet  have wide mouths and narrow exit points. When combined with the bullets forward velocity into soft tissue the design of the ARX flutes causes an increase in pressure of the fluid.  As a result the fluid is laterally ejected from the flutes at a higher velocity than the actual speed of the bullet itself creating the massive cavitation and wound channels seen in the ARX gelatin tests.<br>- Specially Engineered Profile: Because it has no hollow-point or sharp edges on the nose of the bullet the ARX feeds like a round nose yet retains stopping power and terminal performance that exceeds many expanding handgun bullets.<br>- Precise: Injection molded ARX projectiles deliver exceptional accuracy<br>- High Velocity: Achieves higher velocity and higher energy than many other defense cartridges yet imparts less recoil for quicker follow up shots.<br>- Advanced Materials: Performs in a wide range of conditions and weapons systems including suppressed.<br>       <br>Specifications:<br> <br>- Caliber: 9mm Luger<br>- Quantity: 25 Cartridges<br>- Grains: 65 gr ARX<br>- 1545 fps / 345 ft. lbs.,polypic0009luiarx065-001b00025p.jpg,14.62,0,19.99,0,0.55,2.25,2.25,1.25,Ammunition,Centerfire Handgun Ammunition,AM,POLY,www.polycaseammo.com,60C,65 Grains ARX Per 25,C,813412020661,138008,,,th_polypic0009luiarx065-001b00025p.gif,,,,,,,,,,0,,10,1,13,https://images.dealerease.net/prodpics/polypic0009luiarx065-001b00025p.jpg,1,1,

249386,Buffalo Bore Ammunition,24K/20,7,9mm 125gr FMJ-RN Ball /20,9mm 125gr FMJ-RN Ball (Per 20),After much consideration Buffalo Bore believes there is a need for high quality full power ball 9MM ammunition that will feed through the older 9MM pistols that exist throughout the world in large numbers. Browning High Powers Colt 1911s and German Lugers are just a few of the older/classic 9MM pistols that were originally designed to cycle only with ball ammo.<br><br>Typical JHP expanding 9MM defense ammo has only existed for about three or four decades and has only become super popular for the last two decades and all currently produced 9MM pistols are manufactured to feed JHP (jacketed hollow point) ammunition. However for seven or eight decades the classic 9MM pistols were made to function/feed/cycle with ball ammo and many of those pistols will not reliably function with any ammo but ball style. So we are now producing a high quality full power standard pressure 9MM ball load to service all those classic 9MM pistolsand it will feed/cycle through all currently made pistols as well. Ball style ammunition has feeding advantages because of its round nose smooth profile. This ammunition is made by us in the same facility by the same people as our other 9mm loads. It features flash suppressed powders so as to not blind the user in low light situations which is a huge advantage as there is a great likelihood that if you need to fire in self-defense it will happen in low light when the criminal element is out-and-about.<br><br>Through the use of modern propellants we are also able to propel this 125gr. bullet at velocities traditionally typical of the lighter 115gr. bullets and do so at standard (SAAMI compliant) pressures so this is a very potent ball load. Being standard pressure it is safe for use in ALL 9MM firearms in normal operating condition.<br><br>Specifications:<br><br>- Caliber: 9mm <br>- Bullet Weight: 125 Grains<br>- Bullet Type: FMJ-RN Ball <br>- Quantity: 20 Rounds,buffpic24k20.jpg,17.85,0,25,0,0.65,4.125,3.875,2.75,Ammunition,Centerfire Handgun Ammunition,AM,BUFF,www.buffalobore.com,,,C,651815024110,118488,<a target="_blank" href="http://68.168.105.47/prodpics/restrictions.pdf" >Restricted Areas Document -- Please Read</a>,,th_buffpic24k20.gif,,,,,,,,,,0,,12,20,13,https://images.dealerease.net/prodpics/buffpic24k20.jpg,1,1,

Please note that this ammunition is not intended for older guns. It is made for modern firearms only as some of the ammunition could damage older and weaker firearms. This ammunition is new production non-corrosive in boxer primed reloadable brass cases. <br><br>Buffalo Bore full power loads were originally designed for outdoor uses such as hunting deer or stopping aggressive bears and these full power loads are wonderful for these types of applications. However for general self defense the excessive recoil and muzzle blast of turbo charged 10MM ammo becomes a disadvantage for fast follow-up shots needed for multiple assailants or armed human targets in general. Too much power/over-kill is not a bad thing until you have to deal with the unnecessary recoil and muzzle blast/flash which can put you at a tactical disadvantage. Buffalo Bore designed these new Tactical 10MM loads specifically to give every advantage to the user in the event that your 10MM pistol is needed in protecting you or loved ones against human threat. If your main purpose for carrying a 10MM pistol is outdoor usage we suggest you stick with the full power 10MM (items 21A 21B and 21C) loads. However those of you who choose to carry a 10MM pistol for social purposes would be best advised to carry these Tactical loads which are more than powerful enough to quell any human threat but will offer you more control and faster more accurate follow-up shots. Buffalo Bore Tactical loads utilize low-flash powders. This is an advantage should you be required to drop the hammer in low light which is when most human predators are out and about.<br><br>Specifications:<br><br>- Caliber: 10mm Auto<br>- Quantity: 20 Round<br>- Grain Weight: 220 Grains<br>- Muzzle Velocity: 1050 Feet Per Second<br>- Muzzle Energy: 539 Foot Pounds<br>- Bullet Style: Flat Point<br>- Lead Free: No<br>- Case Type: Brass<br>- Primer: Boxer<br>- Corrosive: No<br>- Reloadable: Yes,buffpic21h20.jpg,22.53,0,31.54,0,0.95,4.25,4,2.5,Ammunition,Centerfire Handgun Ammunition,AM,BUFF,www.buffalobore.com,57G,220 Grains HC FN Tactical Low Recoil/Flash Per 20,C,651815021089,137525,,,th_buffpic21h20.gif,,,,,,,,,,0,,12,1,13,https://images.dealerease.net/prodpics/buffpic21h20.jpg,2,2,

Please note that this ammunition is not intended for older guns. It is made for modern firearms only as some of the ammunition could damage older and weaker firearms. This ammunition is new production non-corrosive in boxer primed reloadable brass cases.<br><br>Buffalo Bore 458 SOCOM is the load Id use if I wanted a jacketed bullet load for use on North Americas biggest game animals. Heres why. The 350gr. JFN bullet is stiff. The tough construction would allow this bullet to be fired at 458 Win. mag. velocities (2500+ fps) and not come apart on impact with big bones. So the 1700 fps muzzle velocity of 458 SOCOM ammo is not enough velocity to mushroom this bullet upon impact with big bones this means it penetrates deeply. This bullet has been shot into countless 2000+ lb. buffalo and large coastal grizzlies. It always penetrates on through despite the angle of the animal. So at 1700 fps it will penetrate several feet (probably 5 feet) through living muscle and bone. This is enough penetration to kill the biggest AK/Yukon moose bison or grizzly. Never mind it is hyper accurate when loaded into 458 SOCOM ammo. This load gives the high muzzle velocity of a lighter bullet with the penetration of a heavier bullet because of its construction.<br><br>Specifications:<br><br>- Caliber: 458 Socom<br>- Quantity: 20 Round<br>- Grain Weight: 350 Grains<br>- Muzzle Velocity: 1710 Feet Per Second<br>- Muzzle Energy: 2272 Foot Pounds<br>- Bullet Style: Jacketed Flat Nose<br>- Lead Free: No<br>- Case Type: Brass<br>- Primer: Boxer<br>- Corrosive: No<br>- Reloadable: Yes,buffpic47c20.jpg,41.41,0,57.99,0,1.8,6.25,2.75,1.5,Ammunition,Centerfire Rifle Ammunition,AM,BUFF,www.buffalobore.com,57I,350 Grains JFN Per 20,C,651815458038,139284,,,th_buffpic47c20.gif,,,,,,,,,,0,,12,1,11,https://images.dealerease.net/prodpics/buffpic47c20.jpg,3,3,

3665,CCI,23614,173,Speer GDHP 9mm 115grain/20,9mm,Speer Centerfire Gold Dot ammunition is manufactured to be the best-period! One key to superior performance is the stringent manufacturing process whish Speer has developed. It all starts with an alloyed lead cor being formed to a basic shape. From there the core goes through a unique electrochemical process which bonds jacket to core one molecule at a time. Speer's Uni-Cor process provides for uniform jacket wall thickness and virtually eliminates jacket slippage or separation. <br><br>Next the bullet moves to a patented multiple "star stab" swaging operation which not only creates the unique Gold Dot hollow point cavity but at the same time forms an extremely uniform heel radius. The uniform heel radius ensures accuracy throughout bullet flight from start to finish. The finished product is a highly engineered bullet that delivers superior performance in accuracy expansion and penetration regardless of caliber since each one is customized.<br><br>Caliber & Bullet Description: 9MM Luger Gold Dot<br>Bullet Wt.
